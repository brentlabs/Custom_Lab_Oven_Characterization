# Custom Lab Oven: Build and Characterization

To complete high temperature laboratory experiments, [our lab](http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~iyer/lab.html) required a custom uniform heating solution. Utilizing the build techniques and components found at [Whizoo.com](https://Whizoo.com), a regular toaster oven was outfit with better sealing, insulation, and control (using the Controleo3).

Being a custom-built tool rather than a commercial product, it is important to [characterize](#characterization) it's performance. This website will serve as reference.

## The Build
Our build was very similar to the one depicted at [Whizoo.com](https://www.whizoo.com/reflowoven) where they have shown the steps in much greater detail. Ours are shown to show the quality of work.

### 1. Sealing
The outer case was removed and the interior and exterior cracks were sealed using a silicone sealant rated for Â°C. This is one of several steps to mitigate heat loss from the interior of the oven.

## Characterization
Characterization of oven performance is done through the software of the Controleo3 itself, and independently using temperature labels distributed throughout the oven.

### 1. Controleo3 Intelligent Tuning and Oven Score
For a detailed description of how the Controleo3 tunes itself and the criteria for the oven score, please see [Whizoo.com](https://Whizoo.com/intelligent).
